# Electric-Vehicles-price-Prediction-using-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-
This repository contains code and analysis for predicting the price of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. The SVM model is trained to answer the question "What price can this vehicle be bought or sold for, given its model, make, and other parameters?"
